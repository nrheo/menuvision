# 🍽️ MenuVision

MenuVision is a serverless AI-powered web app that helps users extract, translate, and visualize restaurant menus. Upload a PDF menu in a supported language (e.g., English or Spanish), select a dish, and see an image generated by AI to visualize the food. This project was built for the **AWS Lambda Hackathon 2025**.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Upload restaurant menus in PDF format  
- 🔍 Extracts text using Amazon Textract  
- 🌐 Detects and translates foreign text using Amazon Translate  
- 🎨 Generates AI-powered food images using Amazon Bedrock  
- ⚙️ Fully serverless backend powered by AWS Lambda and Step Functions  
- 🧼 Clean, modern frontend with interactive UI

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload a Menu (PDF)**  
   - User selects a file from their device  
   - A pre-signed S3 URL is requested via Flask backend  
   - The file is uploaded directly to Amazon S3  

2. **Text Extraction & Translation**  
   - The backend starts an AWS Step Function:  
     - `ExtractTextLambda` extracts text using Amazon Textract  
     - `TranslateTextLambda` detects and translates the text using Amazon Translate  
   - The final translated text is returned to the frontend  

3. **Image Generation**  
   - User selects a dish name from the translated menu  
   - The backend invokes `GenerateImageLambda`, which calls Amazon Bedrock with a prompt  
   - An image URL is returned and displayed on the page

| Service                | Purpose                                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amazon S3**          | Stores uploaded PDFs and generated images                              |
| **Amazon Textract**    | Extracts text from uploaded menus (PDF)                                |
| **Amazon Translate**   | Translates non-English text to English                                 |
| **AWS Step Functions** | Orchestrates the extraction and translation workflow                   |
| **AWS Lambda**         | Powers all serverless logic (text extraction, translation, image generation) |
| **Amazon Bedrock**     | Generates high-quality AI images of selected dishes                    |
| **IAM Roles & Policies** | Controls access between services (Lambda, S3, Bedrock, etc.)         |

## 🔧 AWS Lambda Usage

This app uses **three Lambda functions**:

### 1. `ExtractTextLambda`
- Triggered by Step Function  
- Uses `boto3` to call `textract.detect_document_text`  
- Returns raw extracted text from PDF  

### 2. `TranslateTextLambda`
- Triggered by Step Function  
- Detects language from the extracted text  
- If non-English, uses `translate_text` uses Amazon Translate to convert to English  

### 3. `GenerateImageLambda`
- Triggered by Flask backend  
- Uses Amazon Bedrock (Stable Diffusion) to create an image prompt (e.g., _"high-quality photo of Paella"_)  
- Stores and returns a public S3 image URL  

All three Lambda functions are orchestrated using **AWS Step Functions** and invoked programmatically via the backend.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- 🈲 Add OCR handling for image-based Korean menus  
- 🌏 Support more languages (e.g., Japanese, Chinese) using `analyze_document`  
- 🕓 Save image generation history per user session  
- 🌐 Deploy Flask backend using API Gateway + Lambda for full serverless setup

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Secrets like AWS credentials, bucket names, and ARNs are not included in this repo.  
- Replace placeholders in `config.js` or use environment variables when running locally.
